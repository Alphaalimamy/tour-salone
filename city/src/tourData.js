      " Perfect for a sunset or sunrise race, football games, beach volleyball, or enjoying an ice cream from Gigibontà's, Nicecream, Scoops, or the Bomba ice cream vendors who roam the beach. The Warehouse, O'Casey's live music lounge, and the 232 Complex are just a few of the clubs and bars on Lumley Beach. It's not the best place to go swimming, but it's ideal for fitting in with the locals and watching the sunset. Lumley Beach is located in western Freetown and is within walking distance of most hotels and guesthouses.",

    info:
      " It is the most crowded of all the beaches, but it is the most beautiful. Sierra Leoneans love this spot because of the dramatic background of forested mountains, white beaches, mangroves, the river that flows into the sea, the calm water, and colorful fishing boats. This is where people gather to celebrate birthdays, weddings, or just spend a day at the beach with their loved ones. The busiest day is Sunday, but if you want to skip the crowds, go during the weekdays. And when the beach is crowded, a five-minute stroll along the shore is all it takes to be in complete peace. Don't be fooled by its breathtaking beauty; there are some very high tides here.",

    info:
      "The beaches along the Freetown Peninsula are a sight to behold, with the most potential in the tourism industry. On a clear day, they provide a beautiful and breathtaking reflection of the Sierra Leone flag's colors. The green mountains in the background, along with the white sand of Number Two beach and the clear blue sea, provide a true taste of paradise. Since tourism is still a new industry in Sierra Leone, the beaches aren't overrun with tourists, so they're still in good shape. On a weekday, you might have an entire beach to yourself.",
